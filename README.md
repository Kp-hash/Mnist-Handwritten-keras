# Mnist-Handwritten-keras
Exploring neural network architecturs using the MNIST handwritten dataset and KERAS.
This exploratory task for neural networks in Keras was done using keras and we considered the example of the MNIST digits datasets. We explored different Neural Networks architectures (by changing the number of neurons and the number of layers) and comparing their performances using:

multiple activation functions (sigmoid, relu, â€¦);
Different step sizes;
Varying batch sizes;
Exploring diffferent optimisation algorithms (we used three different values for the momentum when using gradient descent).
Analysing effect of parameter initialisations.
